## Installation

This package is compliant with any `setuptools`-supporting installation procedure. Navigate to the directory containing the file `pyproject.toml` and type in your CLI:
```
python3 -m pip install .
```
## Getting Started

Add your access token into the config.py file. I'll add instructions later but I believe in you. You can do it.


## Structure


 I will outline what the table structure looks like here later...
